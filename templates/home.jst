<h1>Welcome to the Chicago Crime Example Application</h1>

<p>This application demonstrates the Chicago Tribune's
<a href="https://github.com/newsapps/chicagocrime/blob/master/api_docs.md">Chicago Crime API</a>.
This app aims to remove some of the overhead of getting started working with the API by providing
a well-designed Backbone framework for getting and visualizing the API data.</p>

<hr />

<p>There are currently three interfaces to the data:</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="#community">Community area list</a></li>
    <li>Community area detail pages, e.g. the <a href="#community/24">West Town</a> detail page.</li>
    <li>Community summary pages, e.g. the <a href="#community/24/month/1">West Town January written report</a></li>
</ul>
